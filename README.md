# Description

I have created a blockchain NFT play to earn game based off the video game character Megaman.
You play as the character Megaman and are rewarded Tokens and NFTs as the game progresses and 
you jump over the barriers collecting NFT items.  

# The Technology Stack and Dependencies I used:

- Solidity language for writing the smart contracts
- HTML, CSS, Javascript to develop the front-end
- Infura Account on Infura as a node provider
- NodeJS To install Dependencies
- Hardhat Ethereum development environment
- Ethers.js To interact with the blockchain


I used the Mumbai Polygon Testnet network to run the game

# Game setup
Player will have to configure the Mumbai network into their
Metamask wallet, and import RunToken address in it as well 
to see their total amount collected



0x0950a2e33520D15b02A7d666fA017D98947aAEc2 runTOKEN contract address

You press any key to get started, and press space bar to make Mega Man character jump over barriers.
Once you hit a barrier you have to start again, but can collect your tokens and NFT.

you can go to https://testnets.opensea.io/ to view your winning nfts.

Thanks and have fun with it !
